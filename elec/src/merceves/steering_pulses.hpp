// Turns SteeringMotion steps into PWM periods, one step per period, at 1 PWM count per us.
//
// The pulse sits at the end of each period (output inverted, so it's high once the counter
// reaches level), which makes the wrap interrupt fire right as a pulse finishes. The PWM's
// TOP and level are double-buffered: values written during a period take effect at the next
// wrap. So at each wrap, the period that just started was planned on the previous wrap, and
// on_wrap() plans the one after it. Steps are committed to the motion planner when planned,
// up to two ahead of the pulses actually sent; position() counts only sent pulses.
